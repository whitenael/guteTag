            <p>               
                Is our secret safe tonight?
                And are we out of sight?
                Or will our world come tumbling down?
                Will they find our hiding place?
                Is this our last embrace?
                Or will the walls start caving in?
            </p>
            <p>  
                It could be wrong, could be wrong
                But it should've been right
                It could be wrong, could be wrong
                To let our hearts ignite
                It could be wrong, could be wrong
                Are we digging a hole?
                It could be wrong, could be wrong
                This is out of control
                It could be wrong, could be wrong
                It could never last
                It could be wrong, could be wrong
                Must erase it fast
                It could be wrong, could be wrong
                But it could've been right
                It could be wrong, could be wrong
            </p>    
                Love is our resistance
                They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
                Hold me
                Our lips must always be sealed
            <p>   
                If we live our life in fear
                I'll wait a thousand years
                Just to see you smile again
                Calm your prayers for love and peace
                You'll wake the thought police
                We can hide the truth inside
            </p>    
                It could be wrong, could be wrong
                But it should've been right

                To let our hearts ignite
                It could be wrong, could be wrong
                Are we digging a hole?
                It could be wrong, could be wrong

                Love is our resistance
                They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down

                The night has reached its end
                We can't pretend
                We must run
                We must run
                It's time to run
            <p> 
                Take us away from here
                Protect us from further harm
                Resistance</p>
